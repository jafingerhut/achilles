# achilles

A Clojure library designed to ... well, that part is up to you.  A
little bit of Java and Clojure code for testing performance with
multiple threads on the JVM.  The kinds of computations run in
parallel are mostly very simple microbenchmarks, intended to help
understand what is going on without getting lost in complex benchmark
code.

## Usage

Run `lein run help` for some usage instructions.  One example of a run
and its output:

    % lein run IncPrimitiveDouble 10000000 1
    Task Specifier: IncPrimitiveDouble
    Number of Threads: 1
    Job size per thread: 10000000
